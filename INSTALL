                      = Building the Library =

The library may be installed using the (more or less) standard Cabal method.

First we need to configure the build process.
``` > runhaskell Setup.hs configure --ghc
For other configure options do ```runhaskell Setup.hs configure --help```.
Of particular interest for newer Cabal versions is ```-p```, 
which enables library profiling.

Then we need to build the library:
``` > runhaskell Setup.hs build
This will create the library in the subdirectory "dist/build".

Next you may install the library.  Depending on where your Haskell system is
installled and where you are installing the library you may need administrator
privilages to that:
``` > runhaskell Setup.hs install

Now you should be ready to use the library.


                    = Building the Documentation =

To build the library documentation, you can do:
``` > runhaskell Setup.hs haddock
This should create html documentation in the directory "dist/doc".
You may copy these file to some convenient location on your system.

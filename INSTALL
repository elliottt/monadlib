Building the library
====================

The library may be installed using the (more or less) standard Cabal method.

First we need to configure the build process.
> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --ghc
For other configure options do "runhaskell Setup.hs configure --help".

Then we need to build the library:
> runhaskell Setup.hs build
This will create the library in the subdirectory "dist/build".

Next you may install the library.  Depending on where your Haskell system is
installled and where you are installing the library you may need administrator
privilages to that:
> runhaskell Setup.hs install

Now you should be ready to use the library.


Building the documentation
==========================

To build the library documentation, you can do:
> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock
This should create html documentation in the directory "dist/doc".
You may copy these file to some convenient location on your system.

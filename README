1.2 (22 Feb 2005):
  - Added a type for monoids, in Monad.Monoid.  This is not specific to the 
    monad library and should be moved somewhere else.
  - Changed the interface to Writer monads to be more like it used to be in mtl.
    In 'Writer w a', the type variable 'w' is the type of the whole buffer,
    not just the elemnets of the buffer.  We do not use the Monoid class 
    currently available in the library, as it is too inconvenient.  Instead
    we use the Monoid type (see the above change).
1.1: 
  - Added a class and instances for 'BaseM'. 
     It provides an easy means to execute a computation
     in the base layer of a tower of monads.
  - Added 'update_' and 'poke_' functions that do not return a value.

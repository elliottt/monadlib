Simple Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use 'monadLib' you should place the file 'MonadLib.hs'
(and perhaps also 'Monads.hs') in a place where your
implementation can find it.


Cabal Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library supports the Cabal framework which has many options.
To see the available commands try:
> runhaskell Setup.hs --help

A typical installation might look something like this:
> runhaskell Setup.hs configure
> runhaskell Setup.hs build
> runhaskell Setup.hs install

If you have 'haddock' installed you can build the 
documentations like this:
> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock

-- $Types
--
-- The following types define the representations of the
-- computation types supported by the library.
-- Each type adds support for a different effect.

-- | Computations with no effects.
newtype Id a              = I a

-- | Computation with no effects (strict).
data Lift a               = L a

-- | Adds nothing.  Useful as a placeholder.
newtype IdT m a           = IT (m a)

-- | Adds nothing (strict). Useful as a placeholder.
data LiftT m a            = LT (m a)

-- | Add support for propagating a context.
newtype ReaderT    i m a  = R (i -> m a)

-- | Add support for collecting values.
newtype WriterT    i m a  = W (m (a,i))

-- | Add support for threading state.
newtype StateT     i m a  = S (i -> m (a,i))

-- | Add support for exceptions.
newtype ExceptionT i m a  = X (m (Either i a))

-- | Add support for jumps.
newtype ContT      i m a  = C ((a -> m i) -> m i)



-- $Execution
--
-- The following functions eliminate the outermost effect
-- of a computation by translating a computation into an
-- equivalent computation in the underlying monad.
-- (The exception is 'Id' which is not a monad transformer
-- but an ordinary monad, and so, its run operation simply
-- eliminates the monad.)


-- | Get the result of a pure computation.
runId         :: Id a -> a
runId (I a) = a

-- | Get the result of a pure strict computation.
runLift       :: Lift a -> a
runLift (L a) = a


-- | Remove an identity layer.
runIdT        :: IdT m a -> m a
runIdT (IT a)  = a

-- | Remove a strict identity layer.
runLiftT       :: LiftT m a -> m a
runLiftT (LT a) = a

-- | Execute a reader computation in the given context.
runReaderT    :: i -> ReaderT i m a -> m a
runReaderT i (R m) = m i

-- | Execute a writer computation.
-- Returns the result and the collected output.
runWriterT    :: WriterT i m a -> m (a,i)
runWriterT (W m) = m

-- | Execute a stateful computation in the given initial state.
-- The second component of the result is the final state.
runStateT     :: i -> StateT i m a -> m (a,i)
runStateT i (S m) = m i

-- | Execute a computation with exceptions.
-- Successful results are tagged with 'Right',
-- exceptional results are tagged with 'Left'.
runExceptionT :: ExceptionT i m a -> m (Either i a)
runExceptionT (X m) = m

-- | Execute a computation with the given continuation.
runContT      :: (a -> m i) -> ContT i m a -> m i
runContT i (C m) = m i



-- $Lifting
--

-- in the underlying monad to computations that support an extra
-- effect.  Computations defined in this way do not make use of
-- the new effect but can be combined with other operations that
-- utilize the effect.
